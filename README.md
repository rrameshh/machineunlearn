# machineunlearn
 Inspired by NeurIPS 2023  Machine unlearning refers to the process of intentionally removing or reducing certain information or patterns from a trained AI modelâ€™s knowledge.  Model-agnostic algorithm that takes a pretrained ML model (deep neural networks), a retain set, and a forget set and applies the Stochastic Teacher Network to output a model that retains accuracy while also removing traces of data from the forget set. Unlearning evaluation is tested with MIA and the model is hosted on streamlit.  References:  6th place solution for NeurIPS  Sekhari, Ayush, et al.
